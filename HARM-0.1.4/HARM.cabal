Synopsis:		A simple ARM emulator in haskell
build-type:		Simple
description:		A simple ARM virtual machine designed for teaching 
			assembly. See 
			http://tinyurl.com/639v6u for details on internals and 
			examples of how to use it. It is advised you look through the 
			source on the site and try following along to really learn 
			what's going on. Currently the emulator does not use standard 
			ARM assembly, but a custom variant. This will hopefully be 
			changed in the near future.
			.
			Two programs, runarm and dbgarm, are provided which can be 
			used to run and debug the assembly.
